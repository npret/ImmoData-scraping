## remarks
  - Excellent tasks division and explanation 
  - Everything runs from main.py :thumbsup:
  - Excellent docstring and typing :fire:
  - Good project architecture, very clear
  - OOP almost perfect, no new class (Scrapper, Cleaner,...) but functions well defined.
  - Don't forget to delete remaining branches after merge (or if useless)
  - This is a very good project :fire: :fire:
